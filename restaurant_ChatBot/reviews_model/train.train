__label__not not good for the money
__label__liked their steaks are 100 recommended

__label__not did not like at all
__label__liked food was so gooodd
__label__not spend your money and time some place else
__label__liked one nice thing was that they added gratuity on the bill since our party was larger than 6 or 8 and they didn't expect more tip than that
